  "partagerPassion": "✻ I was not trained by a great chef. The idea here is to share a passion. The pleasure of being in the kitchen was passed on to me by my grandfather, my Nonno. My influences? Italy, above all, its aromas, its wines, and its olive oil for simple and authentic cuisine.",
  "cuisineFraiche": "More broadly, it is a fresh, colorful, and healthy cuisine with Mediterranean accents, but also to meet your desires and the challenges you want to throw at me."
